# mc_afk_bot

A simple yet powerful app for leaving a bot AFK in your Minecraft farms.
Features:
 - Just stand
 - Toggle-able sneak
 - Attack mobs that are in range (you can select which to attack, and which not to)
 - Eat when hungry (Very useful when attacking, since it drains hunger)
 - Automatically disconnect when low HP
 - Nearly 0% CPU usage

Currently only 1.16.3 version is supported, and only "offline-mode" servers, adding support for other versions and legal servers shouldn't be hard though.
